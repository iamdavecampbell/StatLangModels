# StatLangModels
Slides from my Statistical Language Models Course taught at Carleton University in Winter 2020.
When I teach I use a mixture of material on the whiteboard, live code demos and slides.  Slides are a low dimensional projection of the course.


This course covers, text acquisition, cleaning, and modelling.  The course goals are a mixture of hands on skills, understanding what the models are doing, and statistical perspectives.  We use tidyverse and at times rely heavily on the excellent book: "Text Mining With R" by Julia Silge & David Robinson www.textmining.com
